## 1 Which issues were the easiest to fix, and which were the hardest? Why?
The easiest issues to fix were the **style and formatting errors** reported by Flake8, such as line length, spacing, and naming conventions.  
These were straightforward and only required small formatting changes.  

The hardest issues were the **logical and type-related bugs** reported by Pylint and found during runtime.  
For example, handling incorrect quantity inputs like `"ten"` instead of integers required input validation and exception handling.  
Ensuring the code didn’t crash while still giving proper error messages took more careful redesign.

## 2 Did the static analysis tools report any false positives?  
Yes. Bandit flagged a few **low-severity warnings** that weren’t actually problems in this context — for instance, using string conversions or logging calls that it interpreted as possible unsafe operations.  
These were reviewed and confirmed as safe because the program doesn’t take arbitrary user code or interact with external systems.

## 3 How would you integrate static analysis tools into your software development workflow?  
Static analysis tools should be integrated both **locally** and through **continuous integration (CI)**:  
- **Local development:** Run Pylint, Flake8, and Bandit automatically before each commit using *pre-commit hooks*.  
- **Continuous integration:** Add them as automated checks in a CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) so every push runs these tools and reports issues before merging code.  
This ensures consistent code quality and prevents regressions across team members.

## 4 What tangible improvements did you observe in the code quality, readability, or robustness after applying the fixes?  
After cleaning and re-testing the code:  
- The program became **more stable** and handled invalid inputs gracefully without crashing.  
- The structure is **simpler and more readable**, with clear logging instead of print statements.  
- Code follows **PEP 8 standards** and is easier to maintain.  
- Bandit showed **no high-severity security issues**, improving confidence in code safety.  
Overall, the inventory system is now cleaner, safer, and more professional.
